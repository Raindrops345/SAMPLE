      <h2 class="title">THE BRIEF HISTORY OF QUADRATIC EQUATION</h2>
      <p>The term "quadratic equations" originates from the Latin word "quadratus," meaning "square," indicating that these equations involve terms with squared variables. Hence, they are often referred to as "equations of degree 2."</p>
      <br>
      <p>Throughout history, quadratic equations have played a significant role, with evidence of their practical applications dating back as early as 2050 BC. Mathematicians from various ancient civilizations, including Babylonia, Egypt, Greece, China, and India, employed geometric methods to solve quadratic equations. These early scholars laid the groundwork for future developments in quadratic equation solutions.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In the 12th century, in Spain, the Jewish mathematician Abraham bar Hiyya Ha-Nasi authored a seminal European text that presented a comprehensive solution to general quadratic equations. His work marked a significant advancement in the understanding and application of quadratic equations in European mathematical thought.</p>
      <br>
      <p>However, it wasn't until 1637 that René Descartes, in his seminal work "La Géométrie," consolidated and published the quadratic equation formulas that are still widely used today. Descartes' contributions provided a systematic framework for solving quadratic equations, establishing a cornerstone in the development of algebraic methods.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The evolution of quadratic equations spans millennia until now, with contributions from diverse mathematicians innovating the way for different algebraic techniques used today. From ancient geometric methods to modern algebraic formulations, the journey of quadratic equations reflects the enduring quest for mathematical understanding and innovation throughout history.</p>

              <h2 class="title is-4">PARTS OF QUADRATIC EQUATIONS</h2>
              <p>The theory and principles of quadratic equations form a fundamental part of algebra, dating back to ancient civilizations such as Babylonian and Indian mathematicians. A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of degree 2, meaning the highest power of the variable (usually denoted as x) is 2. Its general form is:<br><br>ax2 + bx + c = 0<br><br>Where a, b, and c are constants, and a ≠ 0 (if a = 0, the equation becomes linear, not quadratic). The solutions to this equation, called roots or zeroes, can be found using various methods.</p>

              <p>While traditional algebraic methods are essential, alternative techniques such as graphical interpretations, factoring, completing the square, and historical approaches provide invaluable opportunities for students to deepen their understanding, foster critical thinking skills, and enhance problem-solving abilities. These alternative methods not only cater to different learning styles and abilities but also promote creativity and flexibility in approaching mathematical challenges. By exploring </p>
